doctype html

alert('Slim supports embedded javascript!')

      p This example shows you what a basic Slim file looks like.

      == yield

      - unless items.empty?
        table
          - items.each do |item|
            tr
              td.name = item.name
              td.price = item.price
      - else
        p
         | No items found.  Please add some inventory.
           Thank you!
